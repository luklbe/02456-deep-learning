Notes on CNN's

Classical deep neural nets have a problem with the vanishing gradient. The gradient tends to get smaller as we move backwards from the output to the input.
So layers closer to the input learn slower.

CNN's idea is that we can extract features of images or whatever we are applying on, so we can share the weights in different parts of the input

For a given filter with lighter color on the bottom and darket on top, if we apply it to different parts of the image, we will sort of activate those parts that 
have lighter color on the bottom and darker on the top
